# site_colorize

I was curious about how the element selector works in browser developer tools, so I created an extension that replicates this functionality and allows you to change the color of selected elements.

While the basic functionality is working, the interface is still in an early stage.

Here's how to use the extension:

1. Open the extension on any webpage.
2. Toggle the on/off switch to activate the element selector.
3. Choose a color and click "Use Color."
3. Hover your mouse over different elements on the page. The border of the element under your mouse will turn green to indicate selection.
4. To change the color of a selected element, press "c."
5. To revert the color to its previous state, press "u."

Troubleshooting:
If the extension isn't working as expected, consider potential conflicts with other extensions, such as Vimium. Try temporarily disabling other extensions to see if it resolves the issue.
